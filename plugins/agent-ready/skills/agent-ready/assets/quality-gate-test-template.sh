# Self-test for the quality gate. Proves, against the installed configuration:
#   1. unchanged legacy debt passes          (clean tree, real baseline copy)
#   2. new / worsened debt fails             (synthetic fixture over the threshold)
#   3. stale baseline entries are removed    (injected entry -> check fails -> prune -> passes)
#
# Works on a temporary copy of the baseline so the real one is never touched.
# The copy is marked reviewed: the real baseline's review state is enforced by
# `check` in CI, while this test isolates the comparison behaviour, so it can
# run before a reviewer approves the baseline.
# Fill in the three placeholders for the project, then wire this into the test
# command and CI.
#
#   FIXTURE_PATH    a source path the complexity check scans (must not already exist)
#   FIXTURE_BODY    one function over the complexity threshold, in the project's language
#                   (see references/quality-gates-pattern.md, "Debt Fixture Snippets")
#   GATE            how the gate is invoked
