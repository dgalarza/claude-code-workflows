# MCP Servers Worth Installing

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers extend Claude Code's capabilities by connecting to external tools and services.

## Recommended Servers

1. **Linear** - Project management integration. Fetch issues, update status, and create branches based on issue details.
2. **Memory** - Persistent context across sessions. Claude remembers decisions, patterns, and prior feedback.
3. **Sentry** - Debug production errors. Pull error details, stack traces, and affected users directly into Claude.

## Setup

See the [MCP Server Recommendations](../configs/mcp-servers.md) guide for installation instructions, configuration options, and usage tips.
