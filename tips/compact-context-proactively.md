# Compact Context Proactively

Don't wait until Claude starts forgetting things. Compact when you:

- **Finish a logical unit of work** - After implementing a feature or fixing a bug, compact before moving on.
- **Switch tasks** - Context from the previous task adds noise. Clear it.
- **Notice high token usage** - Check the status bar. If you're getting high, compact.

## Usage

```bash
/compact
```

You can also provide a summary focus to guide what gets preserved:

```bash
/compact focus on the authentication changes
```

This helps Claude retain the most relevant context while freeing up space.
