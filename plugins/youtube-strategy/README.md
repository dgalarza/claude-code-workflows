## What It Does

Guides the full YouTube video workflow from idea validation through publishing, with emphasis on the critical relationship between title, thumbnail, and hook.

## The Packaging Contract

**Title + Thumbnail + Hook are ONE unit.** They form a contract with the viewer:

1. **Title + Thumbnail** make a promise that creates curiosity
2. **Hook (first 20 seconds)** must deliver on that promise immediately

The skill ensures these three elements work together, not in isolation.

## Workflow Stages

### 1. Ideation

Validate ideas before investing production time:

- **Differentiation Test**: "Would you spend $1,000 making this video?"
- **Audience Avatar**: Does this serve your target viewer?
- **Algorithm Fit**: Will this confuse YouTube about who to recommend to?

### 2. Packaging

Title, thumbnail, and hook developed as a unified unit:

**Titles**
- Formula patterns that drive clicks
- Pre-publish checklist

**Thumbnails**
- Visual design principles
- The 3-element rule
- Technical content templates

**The Hook (0-20 seconds)**
- 0-5s: Click confirmation
- 5-12s: Promise amplification
- 12-20s: Content preview
- Hook templates by video type

### 3. Scripting

Structure for retention:

- **Anticipation-validation loops** (the "seesaw" pattern)
- **Head fakes** and misdirection techniques
- Every ~3 minutes should have tension or release
- Pacing strategies for technical content

### 4. Post-Production

Final elements before publishing:

**Description**
- SEO structure
- Template for technical content

**Pinned Comment**
- Five comment types and when to use each

**Viral Checklist**
- Pre-publish gut check

## Key Principle

> A weak idea with great packaging still underperforms.

When in doubt, start earlier in the workflow. The skill will help identify if an idea needs more differentiation before investing in titles and thumbnails.

## When It Activates

When working on anything YouTube-related:
- "Help with my video title"
- "Thumbnail ideas for..."
- "Working on a hook for..."
- "Need a description for my video"
